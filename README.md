This repository will contain my submission for the AI and Arts class

In the second and third project I want to explore the relationship human develops towards AI

We often hear about the fear AI provokes or the neutral utillity AI can bring, but what about empathy towards AI? 

AI create a space where you can have a discussion wihtout speaking to a human. This para-sociabilisation (relationship in just one sense, the AI doesn't, for the moment, develop any feeling towards the human) could impact our way of interacting human to human in the futur.
