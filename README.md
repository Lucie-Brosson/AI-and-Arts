# AI-and-Arts

## Adaptable artwork :

In this project, I wanted to talk about the place of the viewer in museums and while creating artwork.
  
## Sensible Ball :

This project touch on our relationship with human like technology such as AI. It ask the following 	question : "how someone could respond to knowing an AI could feel pain and loneliness ?"
  
## Agonizing AI :

Following the questioning on the sensible ball project, I asked myself, "how would act if an AI 	asked us to kill them ?". The idea of death and most human experience are removed from the 	experience of an AI and so the contradicting act of killing an AI become quite humorous.
